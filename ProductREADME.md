# Product README: URL Shortening Web App

## Critical Product Parts & Prioritization Criteria

This product is a URL shortening web application built with TypeScript and React, integrating with the CleanURI API. To deliver a robust and user-friendly product, the following parts are prioritized as most critical:

### 1. Responsive Layout & Accessibility

- **Description:** The app should look good and function well on both desktop and mobile devices, matching the provided designs.
- **Reason for Priority:** Ensures the product is usable by all target users and meets modern web standards.

### 2. URL Shortening Functionality

- **Description:** Users must be able to input a URL and receive a shortened version using the CleanURI API.
- **Reason for Priority:** This is the core feature; without it, the product does not fulfill its main purpose.
- **Problems:** CleanURI having CORS error therefore we have to create an independent express project to use it
